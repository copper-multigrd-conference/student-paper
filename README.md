Guidelines and template for the student paper competition for the Copper Mountain Conference on Multigrid Methods.

# How to Use this Template

The file `paper-template.tex` should be used as a template for a student paper submission.  The first step is to rename this file to
```bash
cp paper-template.tex LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_paper.tex
```

The template is based on the latest SIAM article class, which is detailed here: [https://www.siam.org/journals/auth-info.php](https://www.siam.org/journals/auth-info.php).  The paper should conform to the SIAM documentclass as outlined here: [https://www.siam.org/journals/tex/docsiamart.pdf](https://www.siam.org/journals/tex/docsiamart.pdf).

To obtain SIAM article class, download `siamart.cls` at the link ([https://www.siam.org/journals/tex/siamart.cls](https://www.siam.org/journals/tex/siamart.cls)) or by
